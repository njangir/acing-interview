// TODO: PRODUCTION REFACTOR - This file appears to be unused and was intended for deletion.
// The MOCK_... constants are now primarily in src/constants/index.ts and should be replaced by Firestore data.
// If any unique logic or UI was here, it needs to be migrated or confirmed as obsolete.

import type { Service, Testimonial, Booking, Resource, MentorProfileData, UserMessage, Badge, UserProfile } from '@/types';

// getFutureDate is now in src/lib/utils.ts
// MOCK_SERVICES, MOCK_TESTIMONIALS, etc., are now in src/constants/index.ts
// DASHBOARD_NAV_LINKS, ADMIN_DASHBOARD_NAV_LINKS, etc., are now in src/constants/index.ts
// AVAILABLE_SLOTS, MENTOR_PROFILE, etc., are now in src/constants/index.ts
// MOCK_USER_MESSAGES, MOCK_USER_PROFILE_FOR_CONTACT, MOCK_BADGES, etc. are now in src/constants/index.ts
// PREDEFINED_SKILLS, SKILL_RATINGS are now in src/constants/index.ts

// This file can likely be deleted if its purpose was only to hold these constants.
// If it had UI rendering logic, that needs to be re-evaluated.
// For now, I'm keeping it structurally similar but it won't be functional
// as the constants are no longer directly defined here.

// To make it "empty" but not break imports if anything still points here (which it shouldn't):
export default function ServiceDetailsPagePlaceholder() {
  return null; // Or some placeholder UI if absolutely necessary.
}
